## 💼 Interview Talking Points

### Elevator Pitch
> "Built a full-stack SaaS platform for environmental data collection that integrates satellite imagery from Copernicus, implements subscription billing with Stripe, and uses PostGIS for complex geospatial queries. The system has 200+ automated tests and processes 7 different vegetation indices daily."

### Technical Highlights
- Advanced PostGIS spatial queries
- Multi-tier subscription with usage metering
- Daily satellite data processing (background jobs)
- 97% test coverage with Pest
- Real-time UI updates with Livewire

### Problem Solved
> "Environmental researchers needed an integrated solution for field data collection and satellite analysis. Enterprise tools are expensive; free tools are limited. EcoSurvey bridges that gap with a scalable SaaS model."
